Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, Form, and TextField are examples of stateful widgets. 

Stateful widgets subclass StatefulWidget.

The FavoriteWidget class manages its own state, so it overrides createState() to create a State object.

The _FavoriteWidgetState class stores the mutable data that can change over the lifetime of the widget,
---

The class also defines a build() method, which creates a row containing a red IconButton, and Text. 

You use IconButton (instead of Icon) because it has an onPressed property that defines the callback function (_toggleFavorite) for handling a tap.
